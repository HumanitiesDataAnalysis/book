# The Gift of Data

Humanists make stories, arguments, and narratives. "Data" is a word that, nowadays, sounds like
it comes from a different vocabulary altogether. Reading belongs to the humanities; data analysis belongs to sciences. Data is used for proofs, discoveries, 
and statistical inference. "Humanities Data" isn't quite an oxymoron, but it comes close.

Moreover, there is a language of data that insists on treating data as a resource. One mantra emphasizes
it as a natural resource; data is to be "mined," or "Data is the new oil". @anonymous_world_2017. The flip side, attractive to humanists,
emphasis data as detritus: as the developer Maciej Ceglowski puts it, "a waste product, a bunch of radioactive, toxic sludge that we donâ€™t know how to handle."@ceglowski_haunted_2015
To think of data in these terms is to enter into one of the culture wars of the 21st century; between
the technologists who see salvation in data, and the social critics who see its inherent flaws.

You can engage in data analysis from either of these angles. But to understand what "data" really means in a humanistic context, it can be helpful to think
etymologically.
"Data" in Latin is simply the plural of the past participle of the verb 'do', to give.
(Every first-year Latin students memorize the foursome "do-dare-dedi-datum"). Grammatically, it means 
the same thing as 'given' or 'donation.' Some scholars (@drucker_graphesis_2015)
have argued that to call data given misrepresents the social process that makes data available to us, the force with which data has been ripped from the world;
Johanna Drucker, following XXX, argues that we should prefer the term 'capta' instead, to remind us
that someone has gone out and seized this information from the world. Humanities data
is always in some sense about *people*; it represents information about people extracted through force,
flattery, or subterfuge. Data-as-capta is a analytic framework that suggests an important responsibility: the humanist must always
carry an awareness of the situatedness of the data they work with, and the social relations and power
that make it possible for it to exist.

If you are on the front lines of a war between the sciences and the humanities, this may be a helpful tack to take.
But there is another way, too, that is closer to the etymology of 'data' in the university tradition.
David Rosenberg has shown how the original uses of 'data' in English language books come from theology and mathematics, where
data means something that your argument rests on.
Rosenberg writes that this tradition was already evaporating by 1800:  "It had become usual to think of data as the result of an investigation rather than its premise. While this semantic inversion did not produce the twentieth-century meaning of data, it did make it possible." @rosenberg_data_2013.

In this etymology, though, is an insight we should keep. *The gift of data is not from the world to the researcher. It is from the reader to the writer.* To talk of 
resources, capta, or science misses that fact. What is given not the relationship between the scholar and her sources, but between the writer and her audience.
"Data," in this sense, means the *premises*
which the author asks her audience to concede--or to give up--or to take as a given--before the argument begins.
The system of geometry is built up from four fundamental axioms which we take to be true. Any rhetorical argument 
proceeeds from some assumptions, that which we 'take for granted.' To do 'data analysis,' in 
this sense, is to work out the system of implications of some of set of evidence; and it is only useful 
if anyone will accept your evidence to begin with.

To write about data is to solicit a gift from your readers; the willingness to entertain your premises while you describe them. And depending what field you are in, the way that
you solicit this gift will be radically different. In the humanities--as in much public writing directed at non-scientists--
it is not reasonable to expect others to accept your data because it's numerical; you must, instead,
lead them along to the idea that data has something to say. (A better word than gift might be *concession*.)

To work with data in this sense is not always to perform scientific inference. It is to plumb the relationships
of the written record and the enumerated record to the people who were reduced to writing and numbers; and it's to engage
in the careful working out of the implications of that record. One key component of rhetoric that is rarely thought of as data analysis is the *reductio ad absurdam*: the rhetorical
form that demonstrates that two premises (two givens; two *data*) can not reasonably co-exist, because they produce
some outcome which is self-evidently ridiculous. This is a claim we'll explore.
