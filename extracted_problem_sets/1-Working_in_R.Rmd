## Exercise: Creating your first project

Getting started is the hardest thing, because it requires understanding--to some degree--this entire software 'stack.' Here's what you should do once RStudio is running.

1. Type the following into the prompt to install the latest version of this package.

```{r eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("HumanitiesDataAnalysis/HumanitiesDataAnalysis", upgrade = FALSE)
```

2. Type `library(HumanitiesDataAnalysis)` to actually load the package.

3. Create a new project for problem sets in a folder on your computer.

4. Type `download_problem_sets()` to download the sets.

5. Start editing the code in the first problem set and run it using the green arrow buttons.
